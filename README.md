## Assignment 2: Array and Object Manipulation

### Objective
Demonstrate your understanding of arrays and objects by creating and manipulating a dataset.

### Instructions

1. **Create an array of objects** representing students. Each object should have the following properties:
   - `name` (string)
   - `age` (number)
   - `grade` (string)

2. **Write a function** called `filterByGrade` that:
   - Takes the array and a grade as parameters.
   - Returns a new array containing only the students with the matching grade.

3. **Write another function** called `averageAge` that:
   - Calculates and returns the average age of the students in the array.

4. **Use loops and array methods** like `filter`, `map`, or `reduce` where appropriate.
